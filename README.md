# Hotel_Management_System
I have created a Hotel Management System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing hotel operations efficiently. The system includes functionalities such as room booking, customer registration, and dynamic availability updates using JavaScript. It provides an interactive dashboard for both customers and administrators, ensuring seamless navigation, validation of user inputs, and enhanced user experience. The design is visually appealing, with well-structured layouts and responsive elements for smooth performance across different devices.
